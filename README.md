# On Automated and Practical Trust Computation in IoT using Multi-attribute Decision Making and Subjective Logic

In this directory, we present the supplemental material for our paper entitled "On Automated and Practical Trust Computation in IoT using Multi-attribute Decision Making and Subjective Logic". The following files are included in this directory: 

* <b>weight_approximation.ipynb:</b> In this file, we present surrogate weights that we obtain by applying different weight approximation methods, namely Rank Order Centroid (ROC), Rank Sum (RS), and Rank Reciprocal (RR).
* <b>converting_scores_to_intervals.ipynb:</b> In this file, we present the method for converting trust scores into an interval that is an alternative to the method we present in the paper (in the following section: Converting Trust Scores into Distrust Interval).
* <b>sample trust computations.pdf:</b> We demonstrate our trust computation method in this file, using the toy trust measurement example given in the paper and a sample trust network.
* <b>IssuesWithPreviousNormalizationMethods.ipynb:</b> We explain in attribute normalization methods that are previously proposed in seminal works of MADM [[1]](#1) [[2]](#2). We discuss the issues that we detect in using these methods in the context of trust computations for IoT. We explain those isues in more detail compared to the paper and present sample scenarios where they can be observed.
