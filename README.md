# On Automated and Practical Trust Computation in IoT using Multi-attribute Decision Making and Subjective Logic

In this directory, we present the supplemental material for our paper entitled "On Automated and Practical Trust Computation in IoT using Multi-attribute Decision Making and Subjective Logic". The following files are included in this directory: 

* <b>weight_approximation.ipynb:</b> In this file, we present surrogate weights that we obtain by applying different weight approximation methods, namely Rank Order Centroid (ROC), Rank Sum (RS), and Rank Reciprocal (RR).
