    "## Converting Trust Scores into a Trust Interval\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "In the paper, we present a method to convert trust scores into a <b>distrust interval</b>. We also experimented another method that is a \"conventional confidence interval method\" to obtain a <b>trust interval</b>. We eventually selected the method that we present in the paper as it yields a narrower interval and less uncertainty of opinion triplets. By conventional confidence interval method, we imply using t-distribution to compute a confidence interval out of trust scores. The use of t-distribution is suggested when there is no knowledge about the population's behavior or sample size is small \\cite{field2013discovering}. We represent a trust interval as $TI_{ID}=[LTB, UTB]$, where $LTB$ and $UTB$ mean lower trust bound and upper trust bound, respectively.  We compute the $TI_{ID}$ as follows for the first method:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "LTB=max\\lbrace 0,\\overline{RFT(d^{ID}_{t_i})}-(t_{{n-1},{1-\\alpha/2}}\\times SE_{RFT(d^{ID}_{t_i})})\\rbrace\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "UTB=min\\lbrace 1,\\overline{RFT(d^{ID}_{t_i})}+(t_{{n-1},{1-\\alpha/2}}\\times SE_{RFT(d^{ID}_{t_i})})\\rbrace\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\overline{RFT(d^{ID}_{t_i})}$ is average of scores, $n$ is the number of data items for a given device $ID$, $\\alpha=0.05$ (significance level), and $SE_{RFT(d^{ID}_{t_i})}$ is standard error of scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using $FT$ scores in Table below (Table IV in the paper) and equations above, we compute $TI_{ID}=[0.0673,1.0000]$. The method we used in our paper resulted in a distrust interval $DI_{ID}=[0.3803,0.5489]$. As seen from these, conventional confidence interval method yields a wider range for trust scores, which means that there are more possible values that the real trust value will be drawn and so it leads to a higher uncertainty.\n",
